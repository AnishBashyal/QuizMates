# QuizMates

**Inspiration**

Our main goal was to make an app that would benefit students, teachers, and schools. Traditional classroom quizzes can often lack engagement and excitement for many students. Our aim was to find creative ways to inspire students to excel in their studies, foster collaborative learning, and elevate classroom spirit.

Introducing QuizMates, a multiplayer web app enabling students to form sutdy groups, join rooms and compete in team-based quiz competitions.

**What it does**

On our hompage, students has the option to either create a team or join an existing one. When a student chooses to create a team, a unique join code is generated, allowing other students to easily join the study group. 

The study group has the option to either create a new quiz room, or join an existing quiz room using the provided join code. Here, multiple teams can compete head-to-head, making learning a collaborative and competitive experience.

A private chat box is provided for each team, enabling seamless communication and discussion of answers. For each question, there will be 3 attempts available and the first group to get the answer earns the point. A leaderboard keeps track of scores, adding an extra layer of excitement to the experience.

Once all the quiz questions have been answered, the final quiz results are presented, allowing students to reflect on their performance and celebrate their achievements.

**How we built it**

QuizMates was brought to life through a combination of these technologies:

- Web Sockets for real-time data communication.
- Flask for the backend.
- Firebase for cloud storage of quiz question and answer.

**What's next for QuizMates?**

In the future, we plan to:

- Auto quiz generation from text materials
- Refine UI
- Develop Content Management System for users and teachers
- To be continued.....
